# Introduction
I specialize in modeling sorption/desorption kinetics within both batch systems and processes involving transport. My primary research emphasis revolves around the mass transfer of suspended particles in heterogeneous systems, as well as the redistribution of mass within individual compartments. The PhD works focus on the following fields:
- Investigate mass transfer shift of coupled film intraparticle diffusion model (both external and internal mass transfer resistances are considered) and its application in lab batch experiments and in the environment (e.g., suspended airborne particles in the atmosphere). 
- Set up advective-dispersive transport with coupled film intraparticle diffusion model by finite volume method and apply the derived model in predicting the leaching behaviors of the contaminated recycling materials. 
- Apply boundary layer theory and Kolmogorov's turbulence theory in explaining mass transfer of suspended particles in lab stirring systems, rivers, and atmosphere. 
- Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with semi-Laplace solutions and physical informed neural networks (PINNs). 

The derived models provide us the tool to better understand the sorption/desorption kinetics of mixtures, which can be easily applied in many fields, such as groundwater remediation, chemical engineering, analytical chemistry, etc.
